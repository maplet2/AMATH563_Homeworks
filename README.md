# AMATH563_Homeworks
A collection of assignments from AMATH563: Inferring Structure of Complex Systems

* **Homework 1**: Exploration of hand written numbers from the MNIST dataset. Specifically exploring
sparse mappings that map the images to their respective labels, and how to achieve those
sparse mappings through the 1-norm.
* **Homework 2**: Attempt to find the dynamic system underlying two different data sets: the first being Lynx and Hare pelt data and the second being a Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical oscillator. Will use model discovery methods to try to solve fort he system
* **Homework 3**: Use neural nets to replicate and predict certain dynamical systems: specifically the Lorenz Attractor, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Lambda-Omega Reaction-Diffusion.
